# nemo_customiser_k8_utils

Just a bunch of scripts and UIs to make using NeMo Customiser more friendly and less manual. Mostly focused on minikube debugging.

##Â CUDA Driver

If on Brev machines you'll need to update your CUDA driver:

```
cd src/
bash update_drivers_to_560.sh
```

## Environment variables

This requires NGC access, so first define:

```
export NGC_API_KEY=
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=
```

## Kubernetes deployment

```
src/nemo-values.yaml
```

```

## Customise models

```
bash customise_model.sh meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct@v1.0.0+A100
```
